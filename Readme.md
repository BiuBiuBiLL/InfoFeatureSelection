Variational Information Maximization for Feature Selection

This package contains Python code implementing variational information-theoretic feature selection. This algorithm selects one feature at a time and gradually optimizing the variational mutual information lower bound.

Only a standard ```g++ complier required.


 
Example installation and usage:

```git clone https://github.com/BiuBiuBiLL/InfoFeatureSelection.git

```g++ -O3 VMI_naive.cpp


See the reference on the implemented algorithm.
